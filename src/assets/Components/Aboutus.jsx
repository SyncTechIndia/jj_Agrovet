              About J and J Agrovet
            </h2>
            <p className="text-lg text-yellow-700 font-bold leading-relaxed">
              J and Agrovet Private Limited is a trusted name in the poultry industry with over a decade of experience, innovation, and sustainable growth. 
              Our journey was initiated by Mr. Sohil Ahmad,
               a passionate entrepreneur with a vision to modernize poultry farming in India.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-yellow-700 font-bold leading-relaxed">
              It all began in 2012, when he founded Sonu Poultry Farm, 
              focusing on poultry trading and own farming. With consistent quality and ethical practices, 
              the venture quickly earned a reputation for reliability and growth.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-yellow-700 font-bold leading-relaxed">
              In 2016, the company expanded into poultry integration, starting with 40,000 bird placements per month. 
              This move marked a shift toward a more systematic and scalable farming model.
            </p>
            <p className="text-lg text-yellow-700 font-bold leading-relaxed">
              Building on this momentum, Jand Agrovet Private Limited was established in 2021, 
              with an increased placement capacity of 1,00,000 birds per month. Under 
              Mr. Sohil Ahmadâ€™s leadership, the company continues to focus on integrated farming, 
              quality production, and strong partnerships with local farmers.
